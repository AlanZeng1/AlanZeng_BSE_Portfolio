# Voice Controlled Robot
The voice controlled robot is a robot that can be controlled using a person's voice, through the use of an app. The robot is able to move forward, backward, turn left, or turn right, based on what a person says.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the creating the app that will eventually control the robot. I designed the layout of the app, as well as programmed the app to be able to send messages to the ESP32, a WiFi microcontroller, which then sends the commands to the L298N motor driver to control the motors. Currently, whenever the buttons in app are pressed, an error message appears. This is most likely due to the ESP32 not being set up yet, so there is no response after pressing the buttons.

# First Milestone  
My first milestone is connecting the L298N motor driver with the arduino and motors, and getting the motors working. At first, I really struggled with getting the motors to work, as I did not understand how the connections between the battery pack, arduino, and motor driver worked. Later on, I learned that the battery pack was supposed to provide energy for the motors/motor driver, and not the arduino. After realizing the problem, I was able to connect the battery pack with the motor driver and get the motors to work.
