# Voice Controlled Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone  
My first milestone was connecting the L298N motor driver with the arduino and motors, and getting the motors working. At first, I really struggled with getting the motors to work, as I did not understand how the connections between the battery pack, arduino, and motor driver worked. Later on, I learned that the battery pack was supposed to provide energy for the motors/motor driver, and not the arduino. After realizing the problem, I was able to connect the battery pack with the motor driver and get the motors to work.
